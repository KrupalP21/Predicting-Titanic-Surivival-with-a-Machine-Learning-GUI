Survival of Passengers on Titanic using Machine Learning and Graphical User Interface

This program consists of clean and polished Graphical User Interface (GUI) that interacts with 8 Machine Learning models and data visualization tools through the use of different Python libraries. The user can interact with the GUI through selecting which model to run on the testing data on, which then takes them to a screen displaying the prediction results of the testing data as well as the general model accuracy. The screen also includes various buttons that, when selected, display complex and attractive data visualizations on the testing data.
